this before being downvoted to Oblivion', 'The bill states that any one who belongs to a persecuted minority in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh can seek and will be given refugee status and a path to citizenship, provided they are Hindu, Sikh, Parsi, Christian, Jain or Buddhist.', 'So basically everyone except Muslims.', 'Now you may ask why is it such a big deal and how it concerns Indian Muslims.', 'Firstly it is against the Indian constitution to discriminate on the basis of religion and accepting this will set a precedent for future bills that discriminate against a particular religion.', 'But lets just ignore that as there are not many Muslims from these countries seeking refuge in India anyway, other than the Rohingyas.', 'So why is it so dangerous?', 'Since independence India has been a secular country and while Islamophobic elements did exist, it has been mostly safe.', 'But since 2014 when BJP came into power, there has been a rise in right wing extremist hindutva ideology.', 'Their blatant propaganda and hate mongering against Muslims in the last 5 years polarized the country and led to their landslide victory in this years elections.', 'And now they are in absolute majority with no strong opposition to oppose them.', 'And they control the media.', 'BJP is backed by its ideological parent group RSS which is a right wing hindu extremist group and one of their main goals is to make India a *Hindu Rashtra* where Muslims are treated as second class citizens.', 'Now coming back to CAB.', 'The bill by itself is not dangerous.', 'But there is also something called as NRC(national register of citizens) which was implemented in the north east state of Assam.', 'It basically is a register of all citizens living in Assam.', 'It was updated in August 2019.', 'Citizens were asked to prove their citizenship by submitting documentation.', 'Now you may think that one can show their birth certificate and prove their citizenship right?', 'Wrong.', 'Since India does not have citizenship by birth, the people of Assam had to prove that not only they were born here but their parents were born here or lived here before 1971 to be included in the NRC.', '2 million people, majority of them Hindus, were not able to produce enough documentation or due to some trivial errors in documentation were not included in the NRC and ended being stateless and were put into detention camps.', 'And now the reason for concern is that BJP has promised that soon NRC is going to be implemented nationwide and unlike in Assam the benchmark date would be 1951.', 'So as mentioned earlier, CAB by itself is not harmful, but combined with NRC it can be very dangerous.', 'And considering the hindutva agenda of BJP/RSS as mentioned earlier, it is obvious that this bill has a much larger purpose than what they claim.', 'First they will implement the NRC and people will have to prove that they, their parents and in some cases their grandparents were born or lived in India before 1951.', 'And obviously a large number of the population will not be able to provide all the documentation and thus not included in the NRC.', 'Then they will use the CAB to give citizenship to everyone but Muslims, thus making Muslims stateless and strip us of our rights.', 'Thats why there are protests going on all over the country by Muslims and secular Hindus.', 'The hope is that the Supreme court will put a stay on this bill.', 'Which personally I believe, is highly unlikely considering how the BJP has also compromised the Supreme court, which is evident from their recent injustice in the Babri Masjid case.', 'So the future is uncertain.', 'Things are only going to get worst from here.', 'I know this thread and any other thread on this issue will be flooded with comments from BJP IT cell who is very active on social media with their propoganda and misinformation.', 'I urge you to not take my word for it but read about NRC and CAB online and also about the history of RSS.', 'Even in the US, the RSS is actively working on their propoganda.', 'In October, during a Cingreessional hearing, many democratic lawmakers unanimously condemned the Indian government for human rights violation in Kashmir.', 'Since then thecIndian government [hired a lobbying firm Cornerstone](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2019/12/06/india-hires-cornerstone-783420) to represent them and change the negative perception amongst democrats', 'India is turning into China except for the economic growth.', 'You have to look at the citizenship bill along with the NRC.', 'Citizenship bill gives citizenship to persecuted minorities from the neighboring countries while leaving out Muslims.', 'That is one reason to protest because while the bill is discriminatory, it is also against the very foundation of India, a country that is secular.', 'They are literally going against the Constitution of the country when they bring in religion as a measure to give citizenship.', "What people replying to you won't tell you, because it doesn't suit their narrative is this.", 'The govt is going against the preamble.', 'These protests are literally for the idea of India.', 'India is and always will he a secular democratic country and this irks the RW no end with their revisionist history.', 'This is one huge reason for the protests.', 'Not because of what another reply on this thread is telling you.', 'Secondly, the govt has been dangling the Spectre of the NRC over the rest of the country.', 'The NRC was implemented in Assam to weed out illegal immigrants that settled in India after the war of 1971.', 'That process in itself was flawed because no one, especially not someone who is poor has documents that date hack decades to prove that your parents,/grandparents were citizens of this country.', 'And even if they were, you would have to prove you were their children, and for that, DNA tests are not valid.', 'So a lot of legitimate citizens, both Hindus and Muslims, ended up becoming stateless.', 'Which is where the CAB comes in.', 'The CAB will grant Hindu, Christian, Buddhist people citizenship so they have a fall back if their citizenship is revoked.', "Guess who doesn't have that option?", "Guess which community's citizenship is under most threat?", "Even if you were born in India, but for some reason can't prove that your parents or grandparents were born as well, and if they were, and you can't prove that you are their son or grandson.", 'What happens?', 'You are rendered stateless.', 'Tell NRC is a highly communal bigoted bill that the government is implenting to pander to the right.', 'And create a votebank, while it goes against the very Constitution of the country.', 'The ultimate aim of this is to make second class citizens out of your largest minority group or take away their voting rights.', "Because hey, if you're stateless in your own Homeland, how can you vote?", "Did you know that they're even building detention camps around the country?", 'What does that remind you of?', "There is a massive wave of disinformation about this that is doing the rounds and I'd advise you to read up on the issue if you can to get a better understanding of it.", 'Also, sorry about the massive wall of text.',
